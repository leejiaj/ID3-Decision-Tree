# ID3-Decision-Tree
Binary decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm

This python program builds a Binary decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm. After building the decision tree, it is checked against the validation dataset. Accuracy is calculated on training, validation and test datasets. Finally the tree is pruned on a pruning factor so that the accuracy is improved.

Pandas is used for reading/pre-processing data.

Program reads four arguments from the command line
1. Path of the Training dataset
2. Path of the Validation dataset
3. Path of the Test dataset
4. Pruning Factor
